# Recorder for Social Service Draftee Distribution
This repo contains a recording tool for the Social Service Draftee Distribution. As social service draftees, we are assigned to different health care and social service organizations around Taiwan at the beginning of our alternative military service term. This responsive web page can record the service organizations and the remaining spots they have during the distribution event, which occurs in the training center I am serving at.

This repo is created as a refresher for my Javascript skills.
